## Spotify: API integration

- As of now we have used the fake data to display albums, artists etc. Now let's try to integrate the [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/) or any similar API to fetch the data
- With the help of `componentDidMount` and other lifecycle methods, call an API in `Albums` component to fetch the albums data
- Modify or reconstruct the data according to the spotify data and display the albums
